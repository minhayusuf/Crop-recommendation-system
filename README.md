# Crop-recommendation-system

## Project Description
This project aims to provide personalized crop suggestions to farmers based on various factors influencing crop yield. These factors include:
### About the Dataset
This project utilizes agricultural data containing information on soil nutrients, climate, and historical crop yield data. Based on these factors, suitable crops are recommended for farmers.
**Soil Nutrients:**
* Nitrogen (N) content
* Phosphorus (P) content
* Potassium (K) content
**Climate:**
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Rainfall
* Soil pH

## Tools Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- NumPy: Provides efficient numerical operations with arrays.
- Pandas: Facilitates data manipulation and analysis.
-Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
-Scikit-learn: Offers a variety of machine learning algorithms for crop recommendation.
-Plotly: Employed for creating interactive visualizations.
Data Loading

The script begins by loading the CSV dataset containing the aforementioned crop-related factors and their corresponding crop labels.

Python
import pandas as pd

crop = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/luminar/projects/crop recommendation system/Crop_recommendation.csv')
Use code with caution.

Data Exploration

Data Description: Provides an overview of the data, including data types, missing values, and basic statistics for each feature.
Data Visualization: Creates various visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts) to explore relationships between features and identify potential patterns.
Model Building (Replace with your chosen approach)

This section outlines the steps involved in building your crop recommendation model. Here, you'll detail the chosen machine learning algorithm, its training process, and any hyperparameter tuning performed.

Example:

Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm: Depending on the nature of your data and the desired outcome, different algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) might be suitable choices.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for the chosen algorithm. This may involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical ones, and scaling features if necessary.
Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set evaluates the model's performance on unseen data.
Model Training: Train the chosen machine learning algorithm on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Based on the evaluation results, you may need to refine the model or try a different algorithm.
Results

This section presents the results of your model's performance and how well it predicts suitable crops based on the input features.

Future Enhancements

Incorporate additional factors: Consider including factors like soil type, pest and disease prevalence, and historical crop yields in the surrounding area.
Real-time data integration: Integrate real-time weather data to provide more dynamic crop recommendations.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers to easily input their data and receive crop suggestions.
Conclusion

This Crop Recommendation System demonstrates the potential of machine learning to assist farmers in selecting suitable crops based on soil conditions, climate, and historical data. By continuously improving the model and incorporating additional factors, this system can empower farmers to make informed decisions and optimize their crop yields.
